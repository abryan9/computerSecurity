## Problem 1: What are the two principle requirements for the secure use of symmetric encryption? ##


---

## Problem 2: What properties must a hash function have to be useful for message authentication? ##


---

## Problem 3: Suppose someone suggests the following way to confirm that the two of you are both in possession of the same secret key. You create a random bit string the length of the key, XOR it with the key, and send the result over the channel. Your partner XORs the incoming block with the key (hopefully the same as yours) and sends it back. You check, and if what you receive is your original random string, you have verified that your partner has the same secret key, yet neither of you transmitted the key. Is there a flaw in this, and if so what is it? ##

## Problem 4: Suppose H(m) is a collision resistant hash function that maps a message of arbitrary bit length into an n-bit hash value. Is it true that, for all messages x,x' and x!=x' we have H(x) != H(x')? Explain your answer. ##
